# GPX Elevation: Rebuild Plan

The GPX Elevation block has unresolved rendering issues in the current implementation (tag `v0.12.0`). The other two surfaces — GPX Map and the GPX Statistics variation — work as intended and **must not be touched** while this rebuild is in progress.

This document drives a clean rebuild of GPX Elevation in eight steps, after a Step 0 that resets the block to a blank slate while preserving the block's identity (name and icon). Steps 0–7 rebuild the Elevation block itself; Step 8 is a follow-up that migrates the Map block to share infrastructure introduced during the Elevation rebuild.

## How to use this document

The rebuild proceeds **one step per Claude Code session**. Each session opens with a focused prompt along the lines of:

> Read `docs/elevation-rebuild.md` and execute Step N. Do nothing else.

Every step lists a **load list**: the additional `docs/*.md` files Claude should read for that step. Anything not on the load list should not be read. The default load (`CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md` → `docs/coding-standards.md`) plus the step's load list is enough.

Each step uses **test-driven development**. Start by writing the tests that capture the step's deliverables and confirm they fail (the "red" phase). Implement against those tests until they pass (the "green" phase). Refactor as needed while keeping the tests green. Only when the full test suite is green does the step proceed to the release procedure below.

Block-side JS/TS tests run via `@wordpress/scripts test-unit-js` (Jest), co-located with the source as `<feature>.test.ts` / `<feature>.test.tsx`. Do not introduce Vitest or any other runner for block code — `docs/coding-standards.md` is explicit that block code stays on the `@wordpress/scripts` happy path. Any PHP helpers added during the rebuild are tested with Pest under `tests/Unit/`. For interactive verification of editor or frontend behaviour, use WordPress Playground via `@wp-playground/cli` (see `docs/testing-strategy.md`).

Each step ends with a **tagged GitHub release**, not just a commit. Versions follow the pattern `0.13.N` where `N` is the step number — Step 0 → `v0.13.0`, Step 1 → `v0.13.1`, …, Step 7 → `v0.13.7`, Step 8 → `v0.13.8`.

Follow the full six-step release procedure documented in `AGENTS.md` (section *Cutting a release*) for every step: bump the two version files (`kntnt-gpx-blocks.php` and `package.json`), run all gates, commit and tag, build the ZIP via `./build-release-zip.sh`, push commit and tag, create the GitHub release with the ZIP attached, and verify the asset's content type. The procedure is authoritative — do not skip building the ZIP or attaching it, regardless of how small the step's diff looks. See `docs/updater.md` for the underlying reason.

Commit message convention for these releases: `Release v0.13.N — Step N: <short description>`. This matches the existing `Release vX.Y.Z` pattern while keeping `git log` skim-friendly.

No feature branch, no worktree. Work happens directly on `main`. If a step misfires after its release is published, roll the fix into the next step's release (or cut an interim release if it can't wait) — do not retroactively edit a published release.

When a step says "study how v0.12.0 solved this", consult the tagged code via `git show v0.12.0:src/blocks/elevation/<file>` rather than the working-tree files (which will be partially rebuilt or absent during the rebuild).

**Released-step recaps.** Once a step's release is tagged, its spec section in this document is collapsed to a short "Recap" naming what's in the codebase, with pointers to the relevant source files for orientation and to the corresponding `Lock Step N specification` commit (or the release tag) for the full original spec. This keeps the document focused on the *next* step at any moment. Retrieve a collapsed spec in full via `git show <commit-or-tag>:docs/elevation-rebuild.md`.

## Block architecture

The block has three responsibilities, and the implementation should reflect this so each can be developed in isolation:

1. **The elevation chart.** Render the elevation profile of the GPX track from the bound GPX Map. *This is the part that has rendering problems in v0.12.0.*
2. **The cursor.** A draggable cursor on the chart, synchronised with the cursor in GPX Map (movement in either updates the other). *Works well in v0.12.0 — reuse the pattern.*
3. **The tooltip.** A small label attached to the cursor showing distance and elevation at the cursor position.

The steps below take these in order: chart first (Steps 3–5), cursor next (Step 6), tooltip last (Step 7).

## Rendering architecture

The chart — axes, ticks, curve, cursor, tooltip — is rendered **client-side**, not server-side. Frontend `render.php` is small: it emits the wrapper `<div>`, whatever Interactivity directives and `wp_interactivity_state()` payload the client needs (the state payload arrives in Step 5 with the track samples; the directives arrive in Step 6 with the cursor), and a server-resolvable warning when no GPX Map is bound on the page. PHP never emits `<svg>` markup. The orphaned `Render_Elevation` removed in commit `aeb367f` is not reborn under a different name during this rebuild.

The editor preview is a **React component tree**, not `<ServerSideRender>` — the same architecture the Map block already uses. The Interactivity runtime does not bootstrap inside the editor canvas, so the frontend mount path cannot also run there (see `docs/architecture.md` § *ServerSideRender is not used for the Map block's editor preview*). The React preview reads track data via the editor-only REST endpoint `Rest\Preview_Controller` already exposes for Map's preview (extending its response shape if Step 5 needs additional fields). The `__editorBlockSnapshot` attribute and the `useSsrErrorMessage`-style DOM polling from v0.12.0 are not reintroduced.

The rationale is rooted in Steps 3 onward. The dynamic-margin algorithm (Step 3) requires measuring the rendered width of tick labels in the user's chosen typography — fundamentally a DOM-measurement task PHP cannot perform reliably without duplicating font metrics. Resize handling (Steps 3 note 1 and Step 5), cursor sync (Step 6), and tooltip flip-on-overflow (Step 7) are all fundamentally JS. With JS already owning the moving parts, also owning the static parts collapses two parallel renderers into one and eliminates the editor-vs-frontend / SSR-vs-React-state divergence that drove v0.12.0's rendering issues. Frontend and editor share the chart's geometry as pure helper modules (margin computation, tick generation, scaling functions, curve building) but instantiate the result through different DOM hosts — vanilla DOM under the Interactivity API in `view.ts` for the frontend, React in the editor preview.

This decision was reached during the Step 2 design grilling and supersedes v0.12.0's hybrid SSR+JS approach. It is binding on every subsequent step in this document.

## Step 0 (released as v0.13.0) — recap

Empty-slate baseline released. `src/blocks/elevation/` reduced to `block.json` (registration metadata only), `icon.tsx`, `index.tsx`, a minimal `edit.tsx` rendering the placeholder text "GPX Elevation", and a minimal `render.php` emitting the same placeholder. v0.12.0's full implementation (the rebuild's reference) is preserved at the `v0.12.0` git tag — consult via `git show v0.12.0:src/blocks/elevation/<file>` whenever a step's *v0.12.0 reference* note points back to it.

Full Step 0 specification: `git show v0.13.0:docs/elevation-rebuild.md`.

---

## Step 1 (released as v0.13.1, refined in v0.13.1-pl.1) — recap

The codebase has the Elevation block's outer `<div>` with `useBlockProps`, both inspector tabs populated (Settings: Data Source + Tooltip info; Styles: Dimensions, Border, Box Shadow, a `PanelColorSettings` panel with 8 alpha-enabled colour rows, three collapsible `<PanelBody initialOpen={false}>`-wrapped Typography panels via the shared `TypographyToolsPanel` component). `block.json` declares 35 attributes and 6 `supports` blocks. `Color → Background` is wired through a `usefulValue()` wrapper to the inline CSS variable `--kntnt-gpx-blocks-elevation-background`; everything else persists values but has no rendering effect.

For orientation, read the relevant source files directly: `src/blocks/elevation/block.json` (attributes + supports), `src/blocks/elevation/edit.tsx` and `render.php` (the Background wiring is the template for Steps 3–7), `src/blocks/elevation/useful-value.ts` (three-state wrapper), `src/blocks/elevation/inspector-color.tsx` (also exports `elevationColorRows()` — the eight colour attributes' UI metadata as one list, for steps that need to iterate), `src/blocks/shared/typography-tools-panel.tsx` (shared component used by Elevation in Steps 4 and 7, and migrated to from Map in Step 8).

Full Step 1 specification (design rationale, acceptance criteria, manual verification list): `git show 3390f49:docs/elevation-rebuild.md`. The follow-up that aligned the inspector surface with GPX Map's UX (`PanelColorSettings` instead of a custom Color ToolsPanel; collapsible `PanelBody` wrappers around the Typography panels) is commit `d574087`, shipped as the interim release `v0.13.1-pl.1`.

---

## Step 2 (released as v0.13.2, refined in v0.13.2-pl.1) — recap

The Elevation block now resolves which GPX Map on the page supplies its data via the `mapId` attribute. The inspector's **Settings** tab carries a conditional Data Source ToolsPanel that surfaces a `SelectControl` only when the user has a choice to make (≥ 2 configured Maps, or a broken binding with ≥ 1 Map remaining). Picker entries are per Map *block* — no file-based deduplication — labelled through a three-tier fallback (`metadata.name` → `anchor` → `GPX Map #N`). Auto-pick is sticky and re-fires until successful: it writes the topmost configured Map's `mapId` whenever Elevation's own `mapId` is empty / `"auto"`, then stops touching the attribute. Editor preview is React-only (no `<ServerSideRender>`), with the bound payload fetched via `apiFetch` through the editor-only REST endpoint, whose response shape grew from `{ geojson }` to `{ geojson, statistics }`. The healthy state renders a temporary info box `"Bound to {label}. Min: {min} m, Max: {max} m."`; the three broken-binding states render matching warning boxes. The info and warning boxes are placeholders to be replaced by the chart in Steps 3–5; only the warning *state* survives.

For orientation, read the relevant source files directly: `src/blocks/elevation/edit.tsx` (orchestrator wiring the hooks and preview), `src/blocks/elevation/inspector-data-source.tsx` (Data Source panel + `SelectControl`, conditional visibility), `src/blocks/elevation/picker-label.ts` (the three-tier label resolver — pure, shared by inspector and preview), `src/blocks/elevation/use-map-blocks.ts` (recursive block-tree walk returning `{ mapBlocks, configuredMapBlocks, mapOptions }`), `src/blocks/elevation/use-auto-pick-map-id.ts` (re-fire-until-successful effect, live-attribute guard), `src/blocks/elevation/use-bound-map-payload.ts` (`apiFetch` wrapper, dedup-per-id), `src/blocks/elevation/preview.tsx` (warning / info box renderer), `src/blocks/elevation/render.php` (thin proxy delegating to `Render_Elevation`), `classes/Rendering/Render_Elevation.php` (`render_warning()` / `render_info()`, no SVG — the class is the permanent home for the wrapper + state + warning fallback that Steps 3+ build on), and `classes/Rest/Preview_Controller.php` (response shape extended to include `statistics`).

Full Step 2 specification (design rationale, the Q1–Q10 grilling outcomes, acceptance criteria, manual verification list): `git show a9d0352:docs/elevation-rebuild.md`. The follow-up release `v0.13.2-pl.1` (commit `d4bbb11`) fixed three user-reported edge cases: (1, 2) the broken-binding picker rendered the first option as visually selected and swallowed clicks on it — fixed by prepending a synthetic empty placeholder option in `inspector-data-source.tsx` whenever the binding is broken; (3) duplicating a GPX Map caused both the original and the duplicate to regenerate their `mapId`, breaking any existing binding to the original — fixed in `src/blocks/map/use-ensure-unique-map-id.ts` by only regenerating when an *earlier* Map block (pre-order traversal) carries the same `mapId`, so the original keeps its id and only the duplicate gets renamed. The follow-up's touch of `src/blocks/map/` is a deliberate exception to the Steps 0–7 no-touch rule, justified in the commit message.

---

## Step 3 (released as v0.13.3) — recap

JS now owns the entire chart geometry. The frontend `view.ts` registers `callbacks.initElevation` on the shared `kntnt-gpx-blocks` Interactivity store, awaits `document.fonts.ready`, mounts an SVG into the wrapper, runs the margin algorithm against the per-mapId state slice, draws two axis `<line>` elements, and listens for `loadingdone` + `ResizeObserver` events to re-measure on late-loaded fonts and redraw on container resize. The editor preview is the React mirror in `chart.tsx`, consuming the same pure helpers under `src/blocks/elevation/geometry/`. `Render_Elevation::render_chart_wrapper()` emits the Interactivity-bound wrapper (`role="img"`, translatable `aria-label`, `data-wp-interactive`, `data-wp-context`, `data-wp-init`, `<noscript>` fallback) plus `wp_interactivity_state('kntnt-gpx-blocks', [ $map_id => [ 'statistics' => […] ] ])`. Five warning reasons land — `no-map`, `bound-deleted`, `bound-unconfigured`, `no-elevation-data` (Case A), `zero-distance` (Case C). `Dimensions_Defaults` now injects `min-height: 15vh` on Elevation whenever `minHeight` is blank (regardless of `aspectRatio` — a deliberate departure from Map's gate, since Elevation has no SCSS aspect-ratio baseline). `render_info()` is gone; the editor preview's healthy branch dispatches to `<Chart>`.

For orientation, read the relevant source files directly: `src/blocks/elevation/geometry/format.ts` (locale-aware label formatting, m/km switching, locked decimal-digit rule), `src/blocks/elevation/geometry/ticks.ts` (`[1, 2, 5] × 10^n` nice-step series, tick-count derivation), `src/blocks/elevation/geometry/margins.ts` (the `wLeft = widest(niceYLabels) + 0.5em` / `wRight = last(niceXLabels)/2 + 0.5em` / `h = measure("-0,123456789").height + 0.5em` formulas; Step 3 Case-B inflation lives here), `src/blocks/elevation/geometry/measure.ts` (the `<text>` + `getBBox()` measurer; the only DOM-bound module in the geometry layer), `src/blocks/elevation/chart.tsx` (React editor preview — `useRef`, `useLayoutEffect`, `ResizeObserver`, `document.fonts.ready` + `loadingdone`), `src/blocks/elevation/view.ts` (frontend vanilla-DOM mount under the Interactivity API; no store writes, idempotent via per-element `WeakSet`), `src/blocks/elevation/style.scss` (wrapper baseline `min-height: 15vh` + chart SVG `width/height: 100%` + axis colour default), `src/blocks/elevation/preview.tsx` (six-kind discriminated union + dispatch to `<Chart>` in healthy state), `src/blocks/elevation/edit.tsx` (axis-colour custom property wiring + `getDefaultMinHeight()` injection + tick-label typography forwarding), `classes/Rendering/Render_Elevation.php` (the 5-reason warning enum + `render_chart_wrapper()` + per-mapId state emission), `classes/Rendering/Dimensions_Defaults.php` (per-block gate strategy — Map keeps "both blank", Elevation uses "minHeight blank" alone), `src/blocks/shared/dimensions-defaults.ts` (editor mirror of the same per-block strategy).

Full Step 3 specification (design rationale, the Q-by-Q grilling outcomes, acceptance criteria, manual verification list): `git show v0.13.3:docs/elevation-rebuild.md`.

## Step 4: Tick marks and tick labels

**Goal.** The axes carry tick marks and numeric labels driven by the GPX data range.

**Load list:** `docs/blocks.md`

1. **Decide tick count `N`:**
   - Available plotting width: `W_avail = W − w_left − w_right`.
   - Measure the width of an average label.
   - `N = floor(W_avail / (label_width × 1.5))`. The factor 1.5 prevents labels from crowding.
2. **Generate nice tick values (step size `S`):**
   - Divide the data range by `N` to get a candidate step.
   - Round the candidate to the nearest "nice" value from the series `[1, 2, 5] × 10^n` (i.e. 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, …). This gives a linear, easy-to-read scale.
3. **X axis unit logic (m / km):**
   - Generate all X tick values (e.g. 0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000).
   - **Rule:** if more than half of the non-zero tick values are ≥ 1000, convert the whole X axis to kilometres.
   - When in kilometres: divide values by 1000, allow one decimal place where needed (e.g. `"1,5"`), and suffix only the **last** label with `" km"`.
4. **Tick marker geometry:**
   - Length **`0.2em`**.
   - X tick markers start at the axis line and extend **downward**.
   - Y tick markers start at the axis line and extend **leftward**.
5. **Tick label placement:**
   - **X labels:** centred horizontally under their marker; top of text `0.5em` below the axis line; include the unit ` m` (or only `" km"` on the last label per Rule 3).
   - **Y labels:** right-aligned so the text ends `0.5em` left of the Y axis; vertically centred on the marker; include the unit ` m` or ` km`.
6. **Safety margin:** the `w_right` margin from Step 3 guarantees the last X label can be drawn centred without being clipped by the container's right edge.

### Notes

1. All tick label text is rendered with the typography settings from the **Tick labels** panel.
2. Tick markers use the colour from `Color → Axis`.
3. Tick labels use the colour from `Color → Axis labels`.

---

## Step 5: Elevation curve

**Goal.** The elevation profile is drawn inside the plotting area.

**Load list:** `docs/blocks.md`

- Map GPX data (distance, elevation) to SVG coordinates using the dynamic margins and current container dimensions from Steps 3–4.
- Re-render on every container resize.
- Render the entire curve as a **single `<path>` element** for rendering performance.
- Stroke colour comes from `Color → Plot line`.

---

## Step 6: Cursor with cross-block sync

**Goal.** A cursor sits on the curve. The user can move it by hovering and dragging on the curve (desktop) or by touching and dragging it (touch devices). The cursor in GPX Map and the cursor in GPX Elevation stay synchronised — moving either updates the other. **No tooltip yet.**

**Load list:** `docs/blocks.md`, `docs/architecture.md` (Interactivity store, cross-block sync)

**v0.12.0 reference:** `cursor.ts`, `mount.ts`, `view.ts` — both the local cursor handling and the namespaced Interactivity store keyed by `mapId` work well in v0.12.0. Study and reuse the pattern.

Cursor colour comes from `Color → Cursor`.

---

## Step 7: Tooltip

**Goal.** A tooltip is attached to the cursor showing distance and elevation. It flips to the other side of the cursor when it would otherwise overflow the container's right edge.

**Load list:** `docs/blocks.md`

- The tooltip sits **to the right of the cursor** by default. When it approaches the `<div>`'s right edge and would otherwise be clipped, it flips to the **left** of the cursor.
- Two lines:
  - **Line 1:** the X-axis value at the cursor position (distance, with unit ` m` or ` km`).
  - **Line 2:** the Y-axis value at the cursor position (elevation, with unit ` m` or ` km`).
- Typography:
  - Line 1 from the **Tooltip distance** panel.
  - Line 2 from the **Tooltip height** panel.
- Colours:
  - Background from `Color → Tooltip background`.
  - Line 1 from `Color → Tooltip distance`.
  - Line 2 from `Color → Tooltip height`.
- **Visibility gating from Step 1's Tooltip info panel:**
  - `Tooltip info → Show distance` toggles Line 1 on/off independently.
  - `Tooltip info → Show height` toggles Line 2 on/off independently.
  - When both are off, the tooltip is not rendered at all.

---

## Step 8: Migrate GPX Map to the shared `TypographyToolsPanel`, fix the wrapper-sizing default, and expose `mapId` in the inspector

**Goal.** Three changes on Map:

1. Map's two hardcoded Typography panels (*Waypoint name*, *Waypoint description*) are replaced with the shared `TypographyToolsPanel` component introduced in Step 1 (pure deduplication, no user-visible behaviour change).
2. Map's wrapper-sizing default is reduced to `min-height: 30vh` only — the `aspect-ratio: 3 / 1` in `src/blocks/map/style.scss` is removed. The two together duplicate the height-defining mechanism (whichever is larger wins at any given width), which makes the rendered height bredd-beroende in a way the user never asked for. This is a real user-visible change: at widths where the aspect-ratio used to dominate (roughly ≥ 90 vw on a typical viewport), Map wrappers will be shorter after Step 8 than before. That is the intended outcome; users who want the old behaviour can set `aspectRatio` themselves via the Dimensions panel.
3. The Map block's auto-generated `mapId` is surfaced read-only in the inspector with click-to-copy. The id has been an internal attribute since v0.13.0 (auto-assigned by `useEnsureUniqueMapId`, used by the cursor-sync store key and by `Resolve_Map_Id`), but the editor has had no way to *see* it. Step 8 exposes it so the user can paste it into `[kntnt-gpx <key> map="<id>"]` shortcodes (and into the GPX Elevation picker's "explicit mapId" path) when a page has more than one GPX Map. This is the implementation of the favoured direction from [#137](https://github.com/Kntnt/kntnt-gpx-blocks/issues/137) — surface the existing identifier rather than introduce a new one.

**Load list:** `docs/blocks.md`

This is the **first step where Map's source files are modified** — the no-touch rule that applied to Steps 0–7 lifts here. The TypographyToolsPanel migration is mechanical because the shared component was designed to handle Map's two prefixes (`tooltipName`, `tooltipDesc`) from Step 1 and its prefix-mapping unit test already covers them. The wrapper-sizing fix is a one-line SCSS removal plus test adjustments. The mapId exposure is small and self-contained — a read-only inspector row plus a click handler.

**Tasks:**

1. In `src/blocks/map/edit.tsx`, replace the inline JSX for the *Waypoint name* and *Waypoint description* Typography ToolsPanels with two `<TypographyToolsPanel>` invocations:
   - One with `prefix="tooltipName"`, title "Waypoint name", default-visibility matching Map's current panel.
   - One with `prefix="tooltipDesc"`, title "Waypoint description", default-visibility matching Map's current panel.
2. Verify in the editor that both panels render identically to before, that ToolsPanel ellipsis / ResetAll behave correctly, and that attribute reads/writes still hit the same `tooltipName*` / `tooltipDesc*` keys.
3. Remove the `aspect-ratio: 3 / 1;` line from `src/blocks/map/style.scss`, leaving only `min-height: 30vh;` as the wrapper-sizing baseline. The comment block in `style.scss` that explains the dual-mechanism rationale (around the `aspect-ratio` line) is removed alongside it; what survives is "use `min-height: 30vh` as the default, let core's Dimensions block-supports override when the user sets anything explicit".
4. Adjust `getDefaultMinHeight()` and the corresponding PHP-side `Dimensions_Defaults` filter so their condition is **"user has not set `minHeight`"** rather than the current **"user has set neither `minHeight` nor `aspectRatio`"**. A user-set `aspectRatio` no longer suppresses the default min-height; if both are set, both apply and the larger one wins at any given width (normal CSS cascade).
5. Update Map's `edit.test.tsx` cases that cover the default-min-height permutations — at minimum the four tests around lines 537–598 that assert behaviour conditional on `aspectRatio` being set or blank. The post-Step-8 contract is simpler: 30vh is injected iff `minHeight` is blank.
6. **Expose `mapId` in the inspector with click-to-copy.** Add a read-only row to Map's Settings tab — a small labelled control (label: `Map ID`, translatable) whose value is the block's current `mapId`. The value is rendered as monospace inline text (e.g. inside a `<code>` element styled as a button), and a single click on it copies the id to the clipboard via `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`, with a transient success notice (e.g. `wp.data.dispatch('core/notices').createNotice('success', __('Map ID copied to clipboard', 'kntnt-gpx-blocks'), { type: 'snackbar', isDismissible: true })`). The row is shown only when `mapId` is non-empty (i.e. after `useEnsureUniqueMapId` has assigned one — Step 2's empty-mapId derived rule still applies on the Elevation side). No editing affordance: the id is read-only because it is the cross-block binding key, and re-typing it would silently break every Statistics shortcode and Elevation block already bound to the old value. Place the row in a sensible existing panel (or a tiny new `Map ID` ToolsPanel — pick whichever fits Map's current inspector layout best at implementation time). Add a co-located Jest test asserting the click writes the id to `navigator.clipboard` and emits the snackbar.
7. Remove any helper code in `src/blocks/map/` that the migrations leave dead.
8. Run all gates (build, PHPStan, JS lint, JS tests, PHP tests).
9. Release as `v0.13.8` per the per-step release procedure. Commit message: `Release v0.13.8 — Step 8: migrate GPX Map to shared TypographyToolsPanel, fix wrapper-sizing default, expose mapId`.

**Note on Border & Shadow.** The Map block already uses core's standard two-panel layout (one `ToolsPanel` for Border via `supports.__experimentalBorder`, one for Box Shadow via `supports.shadow`) — there is no custom Border-and-Shadow component to refactor. The Border/Shadow surface is left untouched.

**Note on the wrapper-sizing decision provenance.** Task 3 was added during Step 3's design grilling (commit history will show this), after the same single-mechanism choice was made for Elevation's own wrapper (`min-height: 15vh`, no aspect-ratio). Step 3's choice surfaced the latent ambiguity in Map's existing defaults; this task makes both blocks consistent.

---

## When the rebuild is complete

When Step 8 lands and the migration ships, this document is no longer authoritative — `docs/blocks.md` is. Either delete `docs/elevation-rebuild.md`, or move it to `docs/archive/` if the narrative is worth keeping.
